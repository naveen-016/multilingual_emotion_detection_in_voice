🌍 Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project focuses on detecting emotions from voice recordings across multiple languages. It uses speech processing and machine learning techniques to identify the emotional state expressed in audio clips.

## 📌 Objective

To build a multilingual emotion detection system that:

* Accepts voice/audio input.
* Detects the emotion expressed in the speech.
* Works with multiple languages.

## 🎯 Applications

* Call center monitoring
* Mental health diagnostics
* Multilingual virtual assistants
* Voice-based customer feedback analysis

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
* **librosa** – Audio signal processing
* **transformers** – Pretrained models
* **torchaudio** – Speech data handling
* **scikit-learn / PyTorch** – ML/DL frameworks (if applicable)
* **Pretrained models** for emotion recognition (e.g., Wav2Vec2, Whisper, or specific emotion models)

## 🗂️ Project Workflow

1. **Import libraries**
   Load essential Python libraries for audio and model handling.

2. **Load/Process Audio**
   Use `librosa` or `torchaudio` to load and preprocess `.wav` files.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   Extract relevant features (e.g., MFCCs or embeddings).

4. **Load Pretrained Model**
   A multilingual speech model is used to infer emotional tone.

5. **Inference**
   Predict the emotion using the model.

6. **Results Visualization**
   Print or plot detected emotions.

## 📥 Input Format

* Audio files (preferably `.wav`)
* Should contain clear voice samples with emotional cues

## 📤 Output

* Predicted emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral)
* (Optional) Confidence score

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install librosa torchaudio transformers
```

Run the notebook cell-by-cell after uploading your audio file.

## 🛡️ Limitations

* Accuracy may vary by language or accent.
* Emotion recognition is subjective and context-dependent.
